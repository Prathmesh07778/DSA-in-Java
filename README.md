To help you plan for next week, I'll provide a more detailed version of the template with specific topics and recommendations.

## Next Week Planning

### Review of Current Week
- Topics completed:
  - Java syntax and fundamentals review
  - Array implementations and operations
  - Binary search algorithm
  - Time and space complexity analysis
  - Sliding window technique
  - Two-pointer approach
- Challenges faced:
  - Implementing efficient array rotation algorithms
  - Understanding the mathematical proof for Kadane's algorithm
  - Optimizing solutions for O(1) space complexity
  - Converting recursive solutions to iterative approaches
- Concepts that need reinforcement:
  - Prefix sum array construction and applications
  - Two-dimensional array traversal patterns (spiral, diagonal)
  - In-place array manipulation techniques
  - Edge cases in binary search implementations

### Goals for Next Week
- Primary learning objectives:
  - Master string manipulation algorithms and pattern matching
  - Implement both singly and doubly linked lists from scratch
  - Understand circular linked list operations and use cases
- Number of problems to solve: 15
- Specific problem types to focus on:
  - String palindrome detection and manipulation
  - Anagram and substring search problems
  - Linked list reversals (full and partial)
  - Linked list cycle detection
  - Two-pointer techniques for linked lists
  - Merging and sorting linked lists

### Adjustment to Original Plan
- Add additional time for linked list reversals as this is a fundamental technique
- Include Floyd's cycle detection algorithm (tortoise and hare)
- Add practice with StringBuilder/StringBuffer optimizations
- Move some of the advanced string pattern matching to the following week to ensure solid fundamentals
